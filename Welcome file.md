<p>I was pissed when AOC made the comment, because of her failing to <em>explicitly make the comparison</em>.  And before you hit the downvote button let me tell you why.</p>
<p>The term is strongly associated with Nazi Germany, and like most Jews I’m <em>extremely</em> concerned about Holocaust denial.  The last living witnesses to perhaps the worst atrocity of the 20Th Century are dying off, and soon none will be left.  Despite the mountains of evidence and records Holocaust denial will undoubtedly gain traction without people willing to stand up for history.  And unfortunately I don’t believe the lack of brevity was an oversight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t use those words lightly. I don’t use those words to just throw bombs”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a puerile disclaimer.  Of course she used those words with the sole purpose to incite and inflame.  And if the situation at the border is as bad as news reports state it is, then maybe  “throwing bombs” was the appropriate action.</p>
<p>Her explanation was totally disingenuous.  Despite meeting the technical definitions of a concentration camp, I can state with 100% certainty that she knew how people would react and draw comparisons to Nazi Germany.  If she didn’t throw a bomb, she definitely lit the fuse.</p>
<p>I care not a whit about crocodile tears from GOP opportunists like Liz Cheney.9001 open, which should be WS.  Assuming 127.0.0.1, what should the connection string look like?</p>

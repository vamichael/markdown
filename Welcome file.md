I was pissed when AOC made the comment.  And before you hit the downvote button let me tell you why.  Because she explicitly failed to even *mention* the Holocaust.

The term is strongly associated with Nazi Germany, and like most Jews I’m *extremely* concerned about Holocaust denial.  The last living witnesses to perhaps the worst atrocity of the 20Th Century are dying off, and soon none will be left.  Despite the mountains of evidence and records Holocaust denial will undoubtedly gain traction without people willing to stand up for history.  And despite her claims, tbe lack of brevity was **not** a simple oversight:

> “I don’t use those words lightly. I don’t use those words to just throw bombs”

What a puerile statement.  Of course she used those words with the sole purpose to incite and inflame.  And if the situation at the border is as bad as news reports state it is, then maybe “throwing bombs” was the appropriate course of action. Regardless, her explanation is completely disingenuous.  Despite meeting the technical definitions of a concentration camp, she knew with 100% certainty how people would react. I'm not suggesting she was wrong to make the statement, because it's a subject very much worthy of discussion.  People being educatated about concentration camps in general is a *good* thing.  Informing people what their government is doing in their name is proper.

Even though some Jews are now ok with the statement is irrelevant; Not taking into account the sensitivities of the subject, especially for Jews was insensitive, not to mention irresponsible.  While she claims she is innocent from throwing the bomb, she is guilty of lighting the fuse.
